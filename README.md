> The goals of gRandcanyonsand are to:

  - analyze and visualize flow patterns in Grand Canyon
  - estimate the discharge at any river mile in Grand Canyon at a given
    time
  - estimate water surface elevation at sandbar monitoring sites at a
    given time

## Installation

the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Ryan-Lima/gRandcanyonsand")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
#......
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
#..........
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
